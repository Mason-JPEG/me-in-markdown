This summer, I had a amazing summer experience. This summer, I traveled to Florida, Las Vegas, and Big Bear. When traveling to Florida, I visited the 3 Universal Parks. I went on a airboat with a scary, tragic once in a lifetime expiernce and went Jet ski in the ocean. When on the air boat, a storm which formed within seconds hit us creating big waves, fast winds, and a big rain storm. When I was in Florida, I travled to clearwater beach to go Jet Ski in the ocean. This was a fun expierence but scary as the waves were crazy on that day. In Big Bear, we went in the lake and rented a pontoon boat. We relaxed on the lake and ate foot on the boat.
